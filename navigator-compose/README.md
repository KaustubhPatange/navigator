An implementation of [`navigator`](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/navigator) for Jetpack Compose to handle navigation.

**What are the benefits?**

Handle navigation with proper backpress events with animations. No Fragments needed pure `@Composable` navigation with backstack that survives configuration change as well as process death.

dependencies {
    implementation "io.github.kaustubhpatange:navigator-compose:<version>"
}
```
